## Use MLflow with Azure Machine Learning service (Preview)

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is an open-source platform for tracking machine learning experiments and managing models. You can use MLflow logging APIs with Azure Machine Learning service: the metrics and artifacts are logged to your Azure ML Workspace.

Try out the sample notebooks:

* [Use MLflow with Azure Machine Learning for local training run](./train-local/train-local.ipynb)
* [Use MLflow with Azure Machine Learning for remote training run](./train-remote/train-remote.ipynb)
* [Deploy Model as Azure Machine Learning web service using MLflow](./deploy-model/deploy-model.ipynb)
